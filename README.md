# RainbowFrog Discord Bot 🌈🐸

Discord bot to help you generate solid mana base for your EDH deck (or any other 100 card deck with EDH legal cards).

## Bot testing

If you want to try it out join my discord server by using https://discord.gg/uKrM6g2kj9. 
The bot is not public (yet) and can only be used there. 

Right now all the basic functionalities are implemented, feedback is appreciated.

## Command

`/mana [Decklist separated by 1s - required] [ignore lands, separated by |s - optional]` 

Example:

`/mana [1 Adeliz, the Cinder Wind 1 Brainstorm 1 Lightning Bolt] [Volcanic Island | Mana Confluence]`
